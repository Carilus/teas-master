                                 Nouns are words that name a thing, place, or person, i.e., son, chalk, or school. You can break down nouns into various categories depending on what they do. For instance, common nouns refer to general things like the Eiffel tower or John. The sentence, “The eggs were scrambled in the hot pan.” has two common nouns: eggs and pan because they are objects in the sentence.
                                 Proper nouns are things, places, or people with specific titles or names. For instance, dad is a common noun, but their name (or proper noun) is Drew. You should always capitalize proper nouns in any sentence. Collective nouns refer to multiple numbers of objects or a collective group. For instance, class is a collective noun in the sentence: A class of students.

                                 Pronouns replace nouns to prevent sounding repetitive in a sentence or paragraph. They come in singular, plural, and possessive forms. They also come in personal, nominative, and objective forms. Pronouns help eliminate redundancies in a sentence or paragraph, making it easier for people to read and communicate effectively.

                                 Adjectives are words that describe a noun and are used to shed light on what the speaker wants to say about the object. For instance, in ‘She is a smart student.’, the word ‘smart’ describes the object ‘student.’

                                 Adverbs help portray events more clearly and make sentences more colorful. You can find an adverb in a sentence by asking when, where, how, and to what extent. Adverbs are modified verbs and are used to describe comparisons between two things.

It is most often a noun-phrase, pronoun, or noun.
