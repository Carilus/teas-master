                     <p class="pb-10">The tests aim to assess how well candidates will do as nursing students. They determine whether candidates have the academic skills required throughout their program and future career path. Understanding TEAS test scores for nursing will help you better prepare for the tests and increase your chances of passing.</p>

                     <p class="pb-15">There’s no specific limit defining a good TEAS score for nursing. For instance, some schools require candidates to have a composite score for admission, and others need them to meet a minimum score within each field. It helps to check with the programs you plan to apply to get more details about their requirements.</p>
                     <p class="pb-15">TEAS exams are scored on a 0%-100% scale, and candidates will receive three types of scores on their TEAS score report </p>

                     <h3>●	Total TEAS Score:</h3><p> This score is weighed for each test section.</p>
                     <h3>Advanced: 80.0%-91.3%</h3>

                     <p class="pb-15">Candidates who fall within the advanced level indicate higher academic preparedness. The results demonstrate the candidate’s readiness to learn health science and related content. They are less likely to need additional preparation.</p>
                     <h3>Exemplary: 92.0%-100%</h3>
                     <p class="pb-15">These scores indicate high academic preparedness, and students who fall within this category are ready to learn health sciences and other related content. The candidates are less likely to need additional preparation.</p>

               <h3 class="tp-title-sm mb-30">Average TEAS Scores</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Average TEAS scores vary depending on different nursing schools and programs. However, average TEAS scores tend to lie between 65% and 75% and can be classified as proficient in the TEAS score range. Remember that this average TEAS score is a national average. It will vary depending on the program.</p>
            <p>So, what is a good TEAS score? A good TEAS score should get you into a nursing program or school. Most schools set their passing TEAS score at 70%, which could be composite or minimum score requirements for each subject. Candidates should aim to score higher on the tests to become more desirable for nursing programs.</p>

The scoring system places more weight on some questions and less on others, and candidates won’t determine which questions are weighed. Candidates who want to pass their TEAS tests should take the exam with the mindset that each question is equal.</p>
                  <p>Candidates will get a grading report detailing the percentage of questions they answered right in each section. The information will also describe areas where the candidate should aim to improve.</p>

                  <p class="pb-15">The TEAS test report provides test takers with information about their exam scores. The results provide two rankings and four separate scores to help candidates understand their overall results compared to other candidates.</p>
                  <p class="pb-15">As mentioned, a candidate’s total score doesn’t reflect their subtest scores. There are different versions of TEAS tests causing the ATI to weigh the subtest scores and full scores differently. </p>
                  
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-6">
               <div class="sd-service-details-paragraph">
                  <p>Here are some test scores and ranks you’ll find on your TEAS test score report.</p>
                   <ul>
                     <li>●	Adjusted Composite Score: Refers to the over score and is used to determine the fail/pass decision.</li>
                     <li>●	Adjusted Subscale Scores: Used to show how test-takers did on each subtest.</li>
                     <li>●	National Mean Score: This shows a comparison between test-takers around the country.</li>
                     <li>●	Program Mean Score: shows the average score in specific nursing programs.</li>
                     <li>●	National Percentile Rank: This shows the percentage of other test-takers who scored below the candidate.</li>
                     <li>●	Content Area Score: Provided results represent individuals' scores on each section of the TEAS test.</li>
                     <li>●	Sub-Content Area Score: Provided scores have been broken down to provide results for each subcategory.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="container">
               <p>Note that the total score isn’t an average of the four sections. The score is weighed and calculated separately for each candidate.</p>
                     <p>Your Adjusted Individual Score or composite score is your score. However, some programs may have a set of minimum requirements for each section of the TEAS test. Sample TEAS test score results may look like this:</p>
                     <p><ul>
                        <li>●	TEAS Composite Score: 76%</li>
                        <li>●	Reading: 86%</li>
                        <li>●	Math: 66%</li>
                        <li>●	Science: 71%</li>
                        <li>●	English: 81%</li>

            <div class="container">
               <h3>Unscored TEAS Questions</h3>
               <p>Remember that some unscored questions are not counted toward the test score. The test has 170 questions; however, 20 are experimental and are included by ATI to test their validity. Test takers won’t know which questions are unscored. Thus, candidates should do their best to answer each question appropriately.</p>

                        tests. </p>
                     <h3>How can I prepare for the TEAS exam?</h3>
                     <p class="pb-15">TEAS exams require thorough preparation to achieve the desired pass mark like any
                        other test. There are several methods you can apply to prepare for the tests. One of the
                        greatest ones is to take practice tests. </p>
                     <p>There are many free teas tests online that you can use to familiarize yourself with the tests.
                        The free tests will allow you to experience the difficulties before sitting for the exams.
                        Besides, you can use the knowledge acquired to have a focused study for future exams.</p>
                     <h3>How Long is The TEAS Test?</h3>
                     <p>The total time allocated for the TEAS test is 209 minutes. Each section has a specific time
                        allotted for the questions. TEAS science, for instance, is given 60 minutes. With sufficient
                        preparation, the 60 minutes can be enough to answer all the questions within the given time
                        frame.</p>

                     <h3>What science questions are on the TEAS exam?</h3>
                     <p class="pb-15">Under the science category on TEAS exams, there are 53 questions. All the
                        questions should be answered within 63 minutes. The questions are distributed within three
                        types, namely, Human anatomy and physiology (32), Life and physical sciences (8), and Scientific
                        reasoning (7). 47 of the 53 questions will be scored, while 6 will be unscored.</p>
                     <h3>How to pass the TEAS science test?</h3>
                     <p class="pb-15">To pass TEAS tests, focus your reading and practice in areas of anatomy and
                        physiology. Aim to conceptualize both the theoretical and practical aspects of the organs of the
