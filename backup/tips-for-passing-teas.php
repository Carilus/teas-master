                  <h4>Mathematics - 54 minutes</h4>
                  <p>This section focuses on your mathematical ability to make particular
                        calculations. These
                        skills help medical professionals measure vital signs and determine
                        medication doses
                        throughout their careers. It presents questions related to data,
                        measurements, and algebra.</p>

                  <p>The English and language use section tests your grasp of the English
                        language and
                        communication skills. This helps medical professionals make accurate
                        changes and
                        additions to medical records and relay important information to
                        other professionals and
                        patients. The questions test your ability to understand basic
                        sentence structure and

                        information from large blocks
                        of text. This skill is essential for healthcare professionals when
                        speaking to medical staff and
                        patients. The section requires you to read written passages and

                  <p>It's good to plan before beginning your studies to better prepare for
                  the test. You should ask
                  yourself how long you have before taking the test and what study
                  environment you work best
                  in. You should also consider whether you study best alone, with a
                  friend, or in a group.
                  Research what areas you are most worried about and what resources
                  you have to help you
                  with your preparation.</p>
                  <p> Also, consider <a href="https://www.herzing.edu/blog/7-tips-help-you-pass-teas">other things</a>  you must do

                                          from them. Various members of your group
                                          have strengths and weaknesses, and studying together
                                          helps each member learn from the
                                          other. Additionally, different group members will
                                          share learning techniques that could benefit
                                          the entire group.</p>
                                       <p>Partnering with your study group can also help you

                                          the four primary subjects. This helps
                                          balance out your group allowing each member to
                                          develop their knowledge.</p>
                                       <p>For instance, a member who’s strong in reading but
                                          good in math can share knowledge with
                                          one who’s strong in math but flawed in reading. They
                                          can tutor each other to get them better
                                          prepared for the exam.</p>

                                 guidebooks are available to help you study for your

                                 test.</p>
                              <p>Additionally, some tests can give you customized

                                 calm, make better preparations, and
                                 understand how to take the tests.</p>
                              <p>TEAS tests are challenging, and preparing with the
                                 most realistic questions helps you
                                 understand what to expect and how to prepare. Timed,
                                 practical questions provided in the
                                 same format as the actual test are the best ways to
                                 help you better prepare. You may have
                                 to invest in the practice tests; however, it will be
                                 worthwhile.</p>

                              <p>Each section of the TEAS test is timed. Thus, time

                                 the test. Avoid taking too long to answer a question

                              once you finish the exam.</p>
                           <p>You won’t be penalized for the wrong answers, and it
