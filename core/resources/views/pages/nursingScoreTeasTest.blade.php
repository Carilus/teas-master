                     <p class="pb-15">There’s no specific limit defining a good TEAS score for nursing. For instance, some schools require candidates to have a composite score for admission, and others need them to meet a minimum score within each field. It helps to check with the programs you plan to apply to get more details about their requirements.</p>
                     <p class="pb-15">TEAS exams are scored on a 0%-100% scale, and candidates will receive three types of scores on their TEAS score report </p>

                     <h3>Total TEAS Score:</h3><p> This score is weighed for each test section.</p>
                     <h3>Advanced: 80.0%-91.3%</h3>

                     <p class="pb-15">Candidates who fall within the advanced level indicate higher academic preparedness. The results demonstrate the candidate’s readiness to learn health science and related content. They are less likely to need additional preparation.</p>
                     <h3>Exemplary: 92.0%-100%</h3>
                     <p class="pb-15">These scores indicate high academic preparedness, and students who fall within this category are ready to learn health sciences and other related content. The candidates are less likely to need additional preparation.</p>

               <h3 class="tp-title-sm mb-30">Average TEAS Scores</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Average TEAS scores vary depending on different nursing schools and programs. However, average TEAS scores tend to lie between 65% and 75% and can be classified as proficient in the TEAS score range. Remember that this average TEAS score is a national average. It will vary depending on the program.</p>
            <p>So, what is a good TEAS score? A good TEAS score should get you into a nursing program or school. Most schools set their passing TEAS score at 70%, which could be composite or minimum score requirements for each subject. Candidates should aim to score higher on the tests to become more desirable for nursing programs.</p>

The scoring system places more weight on some questions and less on others, and candidates won’t determine which questions are weighed. Candidates who want to pass their TEAS tests should take the exam with the mindset that each question is equal.</p>
                  <p>Candidates will get a grading report detailing the percentage of questions they answered right in each section. The information will also describe areas where the candidate should aim to improve.</p>

                  <p class="pb-15">The TEAS test report provides test takers with information about their exam scores. The results provide two rankings and four separate scores to help candidates understand their overall results compared to other candidates.</p>
                  <p class="pb-15">As mentioned, a candidate’s total score doesn’t reflect their subtest scores. There are different versions of TEAS tests causing the ATI to weigh the subtest scores and full scores differently. </p>

                  <p>Here are some test scores and ranks you’ll find on your TEAS test score report.</p>
                   <ul>
                     <li>●	Adjusted Composite Score: Refers to the over score and is used to determine the fail/pass decision.</li>
                     <li>●	Adjusted Subscale Scores: Used to show how test-takers did on each subtest.</li>
                     <li>●	National Mean Score: This shows a comparison between test-takers around the country.</li>
                     <li>●	Program Mean Score: shows the average score in specific nursing programs.</li>
                     <li>●	National Percentile Rank: This shows the percentage of other test-takers who scored below the candidate.</li>
                     <li>●	Content Area Score: Provided results represent individuals' scores on each section of the TEAS test.</li>
                     <li>●	Sub-Content Area Score: Provided scores have been broken down to provide results for each subcategory.</li>

               <p>Note that the total score isn’t an average of the four sections. The score is weighed and calculated separately for each candidate.</p>
                     <p>Your Adjusted Individual Score or composite score is your score. However, some programs may have a set of minimum requirements for each section of the TEAS test. Sample TEAS test score results may look like this:</p>

                        <li>●	TEAS Composite Score: 76%</li>

                        <li>●	Math: 66%</li>
                        <li>●	Science: 71%</li>

               <h3>Unscored TEAS Questions</h3>
               <p>Remember that some unscored questions are not counted toward the test score. The test has 170 questions; however, 20 are experimental and are included by ATI to test their validity. Test takers won’t know which questions are unscored. Thus, candidates should do their best to answer each question appropriately.</p>
