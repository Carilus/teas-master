                  <p class="pb-15">
                  <p>The TEAS English test measures your skills in several aspects of the English language,
                     including spelling, grammar, punctuation, and sentence construction, among other skills

                     <h4 style="color:#2B547E; font-style:bold;">How many English Questions Are On TEAS?</h4>
                     <p class="pb-15">The TEAS English test consists of 28 questions. 24 of the 28 questions will have
                        marks,
                        while four will be unscored. The test lasts 28 minutes, meaning you only have one
                        minute to answer each question.</p>
                     <p>The four unscored questions cannot be identified, so you need to give every question
                        your best to get the best score possible. The scored questions are distributed as
                        follows; Conventions of standard English (9), Knowledge of language (9), and
                        vocabulary acquisition (6).</p>
                     <p>The TEAS 7 consists of 37 questions derived from the following categories; standard
                        English questions (12), Knowledge of language and grammar (11), vocabulary,
                        expressing ideas, and medical terminology (10), and four questions that are not scored.</p>
                     <p>The unscored questions can&#39;t be determined. All 37 questions should be replied to
                        within 37 minutes; thus, you have one minute to respond to each question.</p>

                     <p>Before answering the questions, it&#39;s important to have the right approach to elevate your
                        chance of giving the best response. The following three steps can help you undertake
                        your TEAS English test appropriately.</p>
                     <h4 style="color:#2B547E; font-style:bold;">1. Carefully Analyzing the Information</h4>
                     <p>Questions related to the English test will give you informational details of a sentence or
                        a short brief. You will then be required to identify elements within the sentence,
                        complete the sentence or address sentence errors.</p>
                     <p>Each question will have a specific task that you&#39;ll be required to complete. You should
                        read each question carefully, paying attention to grammatical rules, spelling, and
                        punctuation, among other English rules. Once you are satisfied with the question&#39;s
                        requirements, confidently give your best answer.</p>

                     <h4 style="color:#2B547E; font-style:bold;">2. Predict The Response</h4>
                     <p>TEAS exam questions consist of multiple choices. Sometimes, it&#39;s possible to predict
                        the correct answer in the given set of answers before you put your final answer. Once
                        you have an answer in mind, finding the correct answer quickly from the choices is
                        possible.</p>
                     <h4 style="color:#2B547E; font-style:bold;">3. Evaluate The Answer Choices</h4>
                     <p>You can use the elimination method to identify the correct answers. The elimination
                        method can be useful if you have a good mastery of the content regarding the
                        responses listed. Begin the process by eliminating answers that you know out rightly
                        they are not the correct answers. You might be surprised how this simple method can
                        help you generate the correct answers.</p>
