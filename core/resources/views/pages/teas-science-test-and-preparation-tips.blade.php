                     <p>The TEAS science section consists of four crucial concepts that learners are examined.
                        The scored sections cover; human anatomy &amp; physiology, life &amp; physical sciences, and
                        scientific reasoning.  
                        There are 53 questions, with six of the questions unscored. The test duration is 63
                        minutes meaning each question should be answered within 1 minute. Since the
                        unscored questions cannot be determined, give every question your best to increase
