                     <h4>i. Ongoing score reports</h4>
                     <p class="pb-15">A good ATI TEAS practice test provides ongoing reports for each test attempt, and students get an end-of-test score report showing where they stand. The scores are crucial for students since they help them figure out tricky sections that they should work on to improve their final scores.</p>
                     <h4>ii. Unlimited attempts</h4>
                     <p>Some ATI TEAS practice tests are free and limitless. However, students should note that some websites provide the same questions for each attempt. While some students may see this as a downside, some students can use the unchanging nature of the questions to determine where they made mistakes and how to correct them.</p>

                     <p class="pb-20">The ATI TEAS practice test has a limited number of questions. These may include a few questions from each subject area with rationales. The questions provided during the practice test are sufficient for students to determine how well they are likely to do in the main ATI TEAS exam, especially if the websites provide score reports.</p>
                     <h4>iv. Upgrades</h4>
                     <p>Students who want better ATI TEAS practice tests may be forced to upgrade their subscription to get more attempts with simulated practice tests to determine if they are ready. Simulated practice tests are more realistic and likely to provide more accurate results.</p>

                                 <p>Candidates should take the full practice test to determine their familiarity with the exam.
