                  <p class="pb-15">Thousands of students eager to join nursing schools have widely used ATI practice
tests. However, one of the critical questions that might be lingering in your mind is
whether the ATI TEAS practice test is the same as the actual test.</p>
                     <p class="pb-10">This article will unearth this subject and cover relevant details you need to know as you
prepare for your upcoming TEAS tests, but let's get straight to the point.</p>

                  <p>The following are some of the similarities between ATI practice tests and actual tests;</p>
                  <h4>1. Same Content</h4>
                  <p>Similar to the actual TEAS tests, the practice exams consist of
                  related content, test duration and the same kind of questions. According to ATI, the
                  practice questions have been created with a similar content just like the
                  actual exam in terms of <a href="https://atitesting.com/teas/practice-assessment?__hstc=96354115.f65ec5d3fb036705d424fbf9ff1d53d4.1680526723902.1680526723902.1680526723902.1&amp;__hssc=96354115.2.1680526723903&amp;__hsfp=3961359083">appearance and feel </a>,.</p>
                  <h4>2. Multiple choices questions</h4>
                  <p>Both the practice and actual tests contain multiple
choices for you to choose the correct answer. Every question comprises a set of logic
for correct or false responses. You have to select the right answer.</p>
<h4>3. 150 Questions</h4>
                  <p>You have 170 questions open to you in both the ATI practice test
and the actual test. Of the 170 items, 150 are scored and are distributed within the
content sections, including; math, reading, science, English and language usage.</h4>
                  <p>The questions tested per section vary depending on the area tested; Reading has 39
scored items, with six unscored. Math has 34 questions, with four unscored. Science
has 44 questions with six unscored, while English language and usage bears 33
questions with four unscored. You can improve your TEAS reading score by practising
sufficiently using relevant practice test questions.</p>

                  <div class="sd-service-details-paragraph">
                  <p>The time allocated for the questions depends on each section, for example, reading (55
minutes), math (57 minutes), science (60 minutes), and English language and usage
(37 minutes). The total time allocated for the 150 questions amounts to 209 minutes.</p>
                  <h4>4. Compatible with multi-devices</h4>
                  <p>You can access ATI practice tests and actual
exams through any gadget connected to the internet, including; laptops, desktop
computers and tablets.</p>
                  <h4>5. Several attempts</h4>
                  <p>ATI practice tests and exams for similar questions can be tried
two times per practice test. This means you can stop the exam and continue later at a
convenient time until the test is finished. On the other hand, ATI exams can be
attempted three times a year, depending on the school&#39;s requirements.</p>
<h4>6. Two versions available</h4>
                  <p>You can explore two kinds of exam forms, A and B. The
two versions contain diverse questions in every practice test.</p>
<h4>7. Score reports</h4>

in nursing and health science-related fields.</p>

                  <h3 class="tp-title-sm">Are Practice Tests Harder Than the Actual Tests?</h3>
                  <p>The difficulty of the questions may vary from student to student. While some applicants
might say the questions are complex, others convey a different message. To be frank
on this issue, the hardness of the questions depends purely on the student&#39;s
preparedness level.</p>
                  <p> Math and reading are among the parts of TEAS tests that many students find difficult.
The two sections cover diverse topics that need more effort on the student&#39;s
participation. The various kinds of math topics tested include; <a href="https://study.com/teas/teas-practice-tests.html"> Numbers &amp; algebra</a>,
measurement and data.</p>
<p>The reading, conversely, assesses the following areas; key ideas &amp; details, craft &amp;
structure, and integration of knowledge &amp; opinions. These are some of the examinable
regions you&#39;ll be tested on, that numerous students find difficult. Focusing more time on
these areas will boost your chance of excelling in the items deemed hard.</p>
<p>If you are well prepared for the exams, you&#39;ll likely score good grades as required by the
schools. There is a need to put sufficient time and effort into preparing for the exams to
achieve excellent performance in your exam.</p>
<p>TEAS practice tests help your overall grade. Exposure to various practice tests will
determine the areas likely to be examined in the exams. With this information, you can
have a focused study in the areas where you might be weak.</p>
<p>You need to study and practice the TEAS test for a minimum of six weeks for good
performance. Sometimes you may need more time to practice for the test. Under such
circumstances, you can program your schedule within the limit you can manage; the
goal should be covering the most crucial topics required in the exam.</p>
<p>There is no penalty for incorrect answers on the TEAS test. So ensure you respond to
each question within the test duration. Make sure to answer all item questions even if
you are unsure of your answer.</p>
<p>Your TEAS test score depends on the school you want to join. Different nursing schools
require diverse scores. Although the passing score ranges between 55 to 70% for a
composite score, you should aim for a good score of 70%. You&#39;ll be deemed an
admirable applicant compared to your opponents with the latter percentage.</p>
