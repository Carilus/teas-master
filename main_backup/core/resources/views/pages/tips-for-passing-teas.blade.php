                  <p class="pb-15">The TEAS test is a standardized, high-stakes admissions exam requiring students to be
prepared and familiar with the material covered. Many nursing schools require their students
to undertake TEAS exams to ensure they have the necessary knowledge and academic
skills to succeed in nursing school.</p>
<p class="pb-10">While not all nursing schools require their students to take TEAS tests, it pays to be
prepared for the exam. The exams can be difficult; however, you can use various resources
to prepare for the test. Here are the tips to prepare for and pass the test.</p>

                  <p class="pb-15">The test has 170 multiple-choice questions that assess the student’s knowledge in:</p>
                  <h4>Mathematics - 54 minutes</h4>
                  <p>This section focuses on your mathematical ability to make particular
                        calculations. These
                        skills help medical professionals measure vital signs and determine
                        medication doses
                        throughout their careers. It presents questions related to data,
                        measurements, and algebra.</p>
                  <h4>English and language use - 28 minutes</h4>
                  <p>The English and language use section tests your grasp of the English
                        language and
                        communication skills. This helps medical professionals make accurate
                        changes and
                        additions to medical records and relay important information to
                        other professionals and
                        patients. The questions test your ability to understand basic

                        information from large blocks
                        of text. This skill is essential for healthcare professionals when

                  <p>It's good to plan before beginning your studies to better prepare for
                  the test. You should ask
                  yourself how long you have before taking the test and what study
                  environment you work best
                  in. You should also consider whether you study best alone, with a
                  friend, or in a group.
                  Research what areas you are most worried about and what resources
                  you have to help you
                  with your preparation.</p>

                                          from them. Various members of your group
                                          have strengths and weaknesses, and studying together
                                          helps each member learn from the
                                          other. Additionally, different group members will

                                          the four primary subjects. This helps

                                          develop their knowledge.</p>
                                       <p>For instance, a member who’s strong in reading but
                                          good in math can share knowledge with
                                          one who’s strong in math but flawed in reading. They
                                          can tutor each other to get them better
                                          prepared for the exam.</p>

                              <p>If you are a perfectionist, you may want to take your
                              time and answer all the questions
                              accurately. However, you may only know some of the
                              questions and could run out of time
                              toward the end of the test. You shouldn’t panic if
                              this happens. Instead, you should move to
                              the next question and answer the difficult questions
                              once you finish the exam.</p>
                           <p>You won’t be penalized for the wrong answers, and it
                              helps if you answer each question
                              since you could be right. Remember your progress
                              throughout your studies and recognize
                              that your strengths will positively impact your
                              results. Understand that putting down your
                              answer is better than not placing one.</p>
